# A PERFECT EVENING

## Description

This app is a wine and cheese tracker. It comes with a cheese and wine pairing guide for reference, to help users get
some idea of what they should be eating with the type of wine they choose. The user can search wines from Global Wines database,
and select a wine to add to their 'wine diary'. In their diary, they can add cheeses that they paired with the wine, and add
additional notes so they can remember for next time.

## Technologies Used

MERN Stack: MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React, NodeJS

Implements token based authentication, and authorization

Frontend communicates with the Express backend via AJAX

## Third party APIs

Global Wines

## Next Steps

Find a better wine API? Or allow user to enter in their own wine if they couldn't find it in Global Wines database.

Have a cheese model with Trader Joe's cheeses.
